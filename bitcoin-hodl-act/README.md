On November 3, 2020, the IRS seized 69,370 bitcoin worth over $1 billion.
The United States Attorneyâ€™s Office (Northern District of California) has filed a civil complaint for forfeiture, 
and I expect the United States to prevail in court.

Past seizures of bitcoin were auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service.

In 2014 and 2015, the United States seized and sold more than 144,000 bitcoin, 
then worth $122 million but now worth almost $3 billion.

The expeditious auctioning off of seized bitcoin was, in my view and with the benefit of hindsight, a mistake. 

The Federal Reserve can create an infinite quantity of US dollars, the proceeds received in the auction. 

Bitcoins can not be created out of thin air and there is a limited quantity of them.

I humbly ask our legislators to pass one of the the two versions of the bill in this directory. 

These amendments would, by operation of law, halt the auctioning off of any bitcoin (BTC) seized by the United States 
until future legislation is passed.

The U.S. Marshals Service is to hold any bitcoin it receives, giving Congress time to deliberate on the disposition of 
this unique asset. 

A large strategic reserve of bitcoin may be crucial for our national security.

Two drafts are in this directory, one amends the already existing Section 566, the other creates Section 570. 

The language is mostly the same in both cases, the format is just a little different.
